# eeVR
Blender addon to render 360째 and 180째 images and videos in eevee engine with support for stereoscopic rendering.

## Getting Started

You will need to get **Blender 2.8** (_Tested on 2.80 (sub 74), branch: blender2.7, commit date: 2019-06-14 23:24, hash: 0fd96b4128ff, type: Release_), download the script **VRRenderer.py**, open the script in Blender and run it (and press the register checkbox if you want it to persist for that blender file). Then a tool panel will appear in the 3D Viewport with 4 buttons that can be pressed to render 360째 and 180째 images and videos. 

**Beware this is still in development so I suggest backing up whatever project you're using this on before beginning the render.**
