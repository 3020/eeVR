# eeVR
Blender script to render 360° and 180° images and videos in eevee engine with support for stereoscopic rendering.

## Getting Started

You will need to get [**Blender 2.8**](https://www.blender.org), install it, download the script **VRRenderer.py**, open the script in Blender and run it (and press the register checkbox if you want it to persist for that blender file). Then a tool panel will appear in the 3D Viewport with mode selection, FOV value adjustment, and buttons for rendering stills and animations. 

**Beware this is still in development so I suggest backing up whatever project you're using this on before you begin rendering.**
